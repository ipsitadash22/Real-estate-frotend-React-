# Luxury Real Estate Website

This project is a luxury real estate website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to browse through a collection of high-end villas, view detailed information and images of each property, and contact the site owners for further inquiries. The website features a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
